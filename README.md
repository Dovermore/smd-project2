## feedback: 


Design class diagram: Missing some multiplicities. Labels could be more meaningful. Communication diagram: Okay. Any conditionals? Report: Understanding of GOF+GRASP principles has been demonstrated. You forgot to talk about coupling, which is quite important to talk about. Otherwise design is good. Implementation: Passed all test cases. Well done.
