## mark: 

17/20

## feedback: 


Design class diagram: Missing some multiplicities. Labels could be more meaningful. 

Communication diagram: Okay. Any conditionals? 

Report: Understanding of GOF+GRASP principles has been demonstrated. You forgot to talk about coupling, which is quite important to talk about. Otherwise design is good. 

Implementation: Passed all test cases. Well done.

Hi Xulin, 

As Philip replied to you, all associations need multiplicities. In terms of your labels, ‘uses’ and ‘contains’ are pretty generic words, and more descriptive words/phrases could have been used to clearly describe the relationships between the classes.

For your communication diagram, I would add that your submitted document is long and complex, and you could have added notes to help the reader navigate the sequence of diagrams.

You only lost 3 marks on the project. Having had a look at your work I agree with your assessor in their marking.

Cheers,
Charlotte.
